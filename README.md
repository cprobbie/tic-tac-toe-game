# Naruto tic-tac-toe

I was thinking to just make a tic-tac-toe game, but as I went I thought adding a theme would make this game more interesting.
I used html, css and javascript to create this game as well as Github to deploy.
All the nine sections of the board were just rectangular blocks and deployed as inline-blocks. 
The background changes to the desired symbol as players click.

This was my first ever javascript project which did exceed the original goal and it was my initiative to extend the project and see what my capability was. Due to the original structure of the code, the time takes to add any new features grows exponentially. Even though there are some cool new features for better user experience that I want to add, the code is now difficult to expand.

The lessen I learned from here is that writing code is a step-by-step process, and only a solid and well-designed foundation can make maintanence and further developments easier.
